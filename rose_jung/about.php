             &nbsp;  Rose Jung is a mixed media artist and teacher.  She was born in New York City and spent her formative years living in Connecticut.  She received her  fine arts degrees from the Universities of Connecticut and Hawaii. She was afforded the opportunity to spend over 10 years living on Saipan, Northern Marianas Islands and Oahu, Hawaii.  In the 1990s, she moved to Florida to spend time with family members.  After years of working in real estate, she decided  to complete her education degree and become a  full time ESE teacher with the Lee County School System. Eventually, she was able to return to her love of  performing and visual arts as an active artist. She now spends her time exploring and experimenting with a variety of mixed mediums; when she is not pursuing her other passion as a global traveler.<br/><br/>
             Art mirrors life in all its complexities and nuances. As a mixed media artist, Rose Jung, views her art as an expression of global changes and importance of recycling, reusing and re-purposing materials. Her art is influenced by the current political, social, environmental climates as well as her extensive travels to Asia, Europe, and her years living on the islands in the South Pacific.
